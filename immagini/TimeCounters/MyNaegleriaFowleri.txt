MY NAEGLERIA FOWLERI 2171' 

Interactive Installation

This work is the last of my Time-Counters series in which traces of time remain visible on textile.

During the process, the circles’ initial form is modified by the tightened threads, defining in this way the works’ final pattern. 
The embroidery evolves independently until the initial marked space is fully filled.

With My Naegleria Fowleri 2171’ a dialogue with sound is introduced by touch, reactivating the time captured on the textile in the past, in the present. 

The spectator becomes an active part of the work when with the contact of his hand enables sound and establishes a new kind of relation with the object.
Adding an actual dimension, renovated and renewable to what already had been.
The Naegleria takes its name from the ‘brain-eating’ amoeba, lethal for the human organism with an average waiting time of nearly 6 days.
A collaboration with Mattia Davide Amico_ sound designer / engineer.
