STATEMENT

My research evolves around the intimate
dimension of time-passing and the process of
familiarization into finding its corresponding physical place.It focuses on an individual suspension of time, which lies beyond the space limits of the common
perception of it.
Every work follows the traces of Origins.
I see origins not only as a native related to birthplace but also as a pretext for a social and
anthropological analysis of the human being.
I measure the body bare of obligations, beyond
impositions and formalized titles, to identify
Cell-ular beings.
